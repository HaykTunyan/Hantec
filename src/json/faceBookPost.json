        "description": "The Fed Initiates First Rate Cut, Gold Surges to 2600 High As expected, the Federal Reserve initiated its first rate cut of the year, reducing rates by 50 basis points. The dollar briefly fell before quickly rebounding, while gold prices surged to new highs before rapidly retreating. Meanwhile, crude oil slightly rebounded after U.S. EIA weekly crude oil inventory data came in below expectations. With several economic data releases today, the focus will remain on market fluctuations driven by these numbers.",

        "description": "U.S. Economy Slows as Investors Turn Cautious Economic trends can't be determined by a single data point; a broader observation is needed to gauge the current cycle. Recent U.S. data, including unemployment, PMI, and inflation rates, suggest an economic slowdown. This cautious environment has prompted significant investors, like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, to shift from stocks to cash, now holding $300 billion. While the market lacks excitement, and AI buzz has faded, the Fed's upcoming rate cuts may offer some direction. Despite the slowdown, the U.S. economy is not in recession, hinting at a soft landing.",

The EIA crude oil inventory for the week ending September 6 also fell short of expectations, causing a brief drop in oil prices. With numerous economic data releases today, market fluctuations will primarily be driven by this data.",

        "description": "Gold Prices Steady Amid Global Uncertainty Last weekâ€™s weaker U.S. non-farm payroll data weakened the dollar, slightly boosting gold prices around the $2,500 range. The Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates in September, with 67% expecting a quarter-point reduction. Geopolitical risks, including U.S. election uncertainties and tensions in the Middle East and Russia-Ukraine, have spurred demand for gold as a safe haven. While central banks, especially those de-dollarizing, continue to purchase gold, retail demand remains subdued. However, gold's movement remains heavily influenced by global events, emphasizing the need for risk management.",

        "description": "Gold is still in a rebound phase within its range and has now reached a key level. It is expected to potentially break its historical high again, so keep an eye on potential opportunities at the upper range. Recommendation :  Buying: Wait for a pullback to the 2,508-2,512 range to buy, with a short-term target of 2,528. The next target is 2,530. Selling: After gold breaks the 2,530 level, watch for whether the upward trend continues or if a false breakout occurs with a reversal. If the latter happens, consider selling, with the first target around 2,513, or potentially lower to 2,500.",

The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard reiterated their intention to retaliate against Israel, and the U.S. Department of Energy announced the purchase of 3.4 million barrels of oil to replenish the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, giving crude oil a short-term boost.

        "description": "As shown in the daily chart, the upward momentum remains intact, so the overall strategy favors buying positions. Recommendation :  Buying: There is a strong support block from bullish orders overlapping in the 1.2954-1.3040 range, which is an ideal area for building long positions. When the price reaches this region, consider buying on the dip, with the first target at 1.3111. The next target would be 1.3234. Selling: For those leaning toward short-selling, watch for the nearest resistance at 1.3118. If a reversal downward occurs, you can consider a very short-term sell, with a target at 1.3044.",
